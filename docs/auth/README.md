# Auth Feature Overview

Authentication enables users to securely register, log in, and manage their accounts. The system uses JWT-based authentication, secure password hashing, and input validation to protect user data. Auth supports internationalized UI, error handling, and provides endpoints for registration, login, and retrieving the current user. All sensitive actions require a valid token, ensuring only authenticated users can access protected resources.
